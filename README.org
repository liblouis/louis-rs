#+title: louis-rs: a liblouis re-implementation in Rust

This is the reduced-to-the-max re-write of liblouis in Rust.

* Rationale
Many if not most of the CVEs of liblouis are rooted in the manual
memory management in the C version of liblouis.

Moving to Rust is of tremendous help not only for the solid memory
management to avoid buffer overflow problems, but also to bring joy
back into liblouis maintenance.

* Status
With the some small exceptions the parser is complete. Translation
using only character and most translation opcodes basically works.

The original YAML test suite is supported and can be used to test the
re-implementation.

Currently, the re-implementation passes 68% of the liblouis test suite
successfully.

* Relation to liblouis

louis-rs is *not* a direct port of the liblouis C code to Rust. It
uses the same tables and the same YAML tests but other than that it is
a complete rewrite. It uses different data structures and does the
translation using a different algorithm.

The goal is to be as compatible as possible with liblouis, when it
makes sense.

* Usage

Get help:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  $ cargo run -- help
#+END_SRC

Translate some text:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  $ cargo run -- translate ~/src/liblouis/tables/de-comp6.utb 
  > Guten Tag
  ⠈⠛⠥⠞⠑⠝⠀⠈⠞⠁⠛⠀
#+END_SRC

Test the parser:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  $ cargo run -- parse
  > nofor letter e 123-1
  Letter { character: 'e', dots: Explicit([{Dot2, Dot1, Dot3}, {Dot1}]), constraints: EnumSet(Nofor) }
#+END_SRC

Run the tests in a YAML file:

#+begin_src shell
  $ LOUIS_TABLE_PATH=~/src/liblouis/tables cargo run -- check ~/src/liblouis/tests/braille-specs/de-de-comp8.yaml 2> /dev/null
  ================================================================================
  8 tests run:
  8 successes [100%]
  0 failures [0%]
  0 expected failures [0%]
  0 unexpected successes [0%]
#+end_src

Run all YAML tests:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  $ LOUIS_TABLE_PATH=~/src/liblouis/tables:~/src/liblouis ./target/release/louis check --summary ~/src/liblouis/tests/braille-specs/*.yaml ~/src/liblouis/tests/yaml/*.yaml 2> /dev/null 
  ================================================================================
  473240 tests run:
  324695 successes [68.6%]
  137803 failures [29.1%]
  10319 expected failures [2.2%]
  423 unexpected successes [0.1%]
#+END_SRC

Test the table query functionality:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  $ LOUIS_TABLE_PATH=~/src/liblouis/tables cargo run -- query language=de,contraction=full
  {"[...]/liblouis/tables/de-g2-detailed.ctb", "[...]/liblouis/tables/de-g2.ctb"}
#+END_SRC

A lot of inspiration for the hand-rolled parser comes from the
absolutely fantastic book [[https://craftinginterpreters.com/][Crafting Interpreters]] by Robert Nystrom.
Surely [[http://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262510875/structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs/][Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs]] has had some
influence as must have the [[https://people.inf.ethz.ch/wirth/CompilerConstruction/CompilerConstruction1.pdf][Compiler Construction]] classes with Niklaus
Wirth ("as simple as possible but not simpler").

The parser is built from the grammar used in [[https://github.com/liblouis/tree-sitter-liblouis][tree-sitter-liblouis]],
which is a port of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form][EBNF grammar]] in [[https://github.com/liblouis/rewrite-louis][rewrite-louis]], which in turn is
a just port of the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar][Parsing expression grammar]] from [[https://github.com/liblouis/louis-parser][louis-parser]].

* Todo [6/15]
- [ ] Parse with context
  - currently tables are parsed line by line. Opcodes have no idea
    whether a character or a class has been defined before
  - Probably need to pass some context to the rule parser where
    character definitions and class names are kept
  - this is solved with a two-pass compilation now. The first pass
    collects all relevant information and the second pass consequently
    uses that.
- [ ] (Emphasis and Caps) Indication
  - presumably this could be done independently of translation, i.e.
    find indication locations and put them in the typeform array
    before even translating.
- [X] Add support for virtual dots
  - Virtual dots are supported and are converted to Unicode Supplementary Private Use Area-A
- [ ] The correct, multipass and match opcodes
- [X] Currently the matching of input text against the rules is case
  sensitive.
  - [X] Make it case insensitive.
  - [X] Now everything is case insensitive, even character
    definitions. This is probably not what we want. We might have to
    move the character definitions out of the trie into a separate
    structure.
- [X] Word boundaries so we could support beg- and endword.
  - the [[https://docs.rs/unicode-segmentation/latest/unicode_segmentation/][unicode_segmentation]] crate would probably help. It has
    functions like [[https://docs.rs/unicode-segmentation/latest/unicode_segmentation/trait.UnicodeSegmentation.html#tymethod.split_word_bound_indices][split_word_bound_indices]], that give you word bounds
    based on the Unicode standard.
- [X] Handle implicit braille definitions, i.e. '='
- [ ] Typeforms
- [ ] Cursor handling
- [ ] Hyphenation
  - will probably be delegated to the [[https://docs.rs/hyphenation/latest/hyphenation/][hyphenation crate]]
- [ ] Add an API so that the functionality can be used as a library
  - end expose it as a C ABI so that it can be used from other
    languages (see also [[https://github.com/mozilla/cbindgen][cbindgen]] or even better [[https://github.com/rust-diplomat/diplomat][Diplomat]])
- [X] Table resolution based on metadata
- [ ] Display tables
  - When testing the YAML files the display tables are used.
  - However normal translation has currently no way to specify a
    display table
- [X] Handle undefined characters similarly to liblouis
- [ ] Use a well established FST or graph library as a bases
  - currently regular expressions are implemented using a simple
    directed acyclic graph. It would surely be better to use a well
    established library for that task such as [[https://github.com/garvys-org/rustfst][rustfst]], [[https://crates.io/crates/petgraph][petgraph]] or
    [[https://github.com/neo4j-labs/graph][graph]].

* Changelog

** Unreleased
*** Added
- Implement support for the multipass opcodes, at least for the ones
  that do not require regular expressions, e.g. rules like
   #+begin_src
     pass2 @123 @15
   #+end_src
  should work now.
- Tracing now works across all translation stages. If any rules for
  pre and post translations are defined these translations are also
  shown.
